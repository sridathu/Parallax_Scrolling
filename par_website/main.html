        <h1>What is Parallax Website???</h1>
        <p>
            A parallax website is a type of website design that creates an illusion of depth and movement by using multiple layers of images or content that move at different speeds as the user scrolls or navigates through the website. This effect is achieved by manipulating the position and movement of the background and foreground elements.</p>
        <h1>Here are some key features of a parallax website:</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Scroll-based animation: As the user scrolls down the page, different elements of the website move at different speeds, creating a visually engaging and interactive experience.</li>
            <li>Multiple layers: The website is built with multiple layers of images or content stacked on top of each other, each with a different scrolling speed. This creates a sense of depth and adds a dynamic element to the design.</li>
            <li>Storytelling and engagement: Parallax websites are often used to tell a story or guide users through a narrative by using scrolling as a means of progression. This can enhance user engagement and make the website more memorable.</li>
            <li>Visual appeal: Parallax scrolling adds a visually striking and dynamic element to the website, capturing users' attention and creating a unique browsing experience.</li>
        </ol>
